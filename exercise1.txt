Step 1: simpledb.Parser.main() and simpledb.Parser.start() simpledb.Parser.main() is the entry point for the SimpleDB system. It calls simpledb.Parser.start(). The latter performs three main actions:

  1. It populates the SimpleDB catalog from the catalog text file provided 
  by the user as argument (Database.getCatalog().loadSchema(argv[0]);).

  2. For each table defined in the system catalog, it computes statistics 
  over the data in the table by calling: TableStats.computeStatistics(), 
  which for each table does: TableStats s = new TableStats(tableid, IOCOSTPERPAGE);

  3. It processes the statements submitted by the 
  user (processNextStatement(new ByteArrayInputStream(statementBytes));)

----------------------------------------------------------

Step 2: simpledb.Parser.processNextStatement() 
  This method takes two key actions:
  First, it gets a physical plan for the query by invoking handleQueryStatement((ZQuery)s);
  Then it executes the query by calling query.execute();

-------------------------------------------------------

Step 3: simpledb.Parser.handleQueryStatement() 
  1. It firsts builds logic plan by calling
  simpledb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan
  
  2. After getting the logical plan "lp", it calls lp's method "physicalPlan" which
     finds the optimal plan

Step 4: simpedb.Parser.parseQueryLogicalPlan()
  1. It first goes over each table name in the FROM clause and call simpledb.LogicalPlan.addScan()
  to add table into logical plan.

  2. It then goes to process WHERE clause by calling
  simpledb.Parser.processExpression to add 
  corresponding filter into logic plan

  3. It then goes to parse GROUP BY clause. It identifies the attribute and then set the value 
  of the GROUP BY field.

  4. It then goes over the SELECT clause. It identifies the aggregation field using getValue()
  and aggregation method (min, max, etc) using getAggregate() and add them using simpledb.Parser.addProjectField(). Or it picks out the column we want to project as specified in the SELECT clause

  5. Finally, it processes ORDER BY. It identifies the attribute it needs to order and
  the order it needs to order by calling getOrderBy() and calling getExpression() to process
  the result. Then, it identifies the attribute it needs to order and the order(ascending or descending) it needs to order. Finally, it uses addOrderBy to add order by information into 
  logical plan.

  6. It returns logical plan.

Step 5. simpledb.LogicPlan.physicalPlan()
  1. It iterates over the table, it gets the name of each table and the 
  corresponding SeqScan and put them into hashmap. For each table, it also sets
  the selectivity of the table to 1.0, as default

  2. It iterates over the filters. 
  For each filter, it gets the corresponding
  subPlan iterator. Then, get the field f and type ftyp based TupleDusc td.
  Then, it adds the name of table and corresponding filter into the hashmap
  subplanMap. Then, it gets the tableStats and use it to get the selectivty. 
  Finally, it gets the current selectivity and multiplies with new selectivity
  it just got and then puts the new value into hashmap

  3. It iterate over the joins.
  For each join, it gets its first plan and the second plan (it is possible 
  the second plan is a subplan). Then, it uses join optimizer which takes
  one join iterator, and two plans it just got to produce a new iterator.
  If this join is not a subquery join, it update the name of t2 in equivMap.
  Then, it sets all table whose name is equal to t2 to t1 to keep equivMap
  updated. Finally, it checks if it only has one subPlan left.

  4. It iterates over the selection list. For each selection,
  it collects the outField num and outTypes. Then, it generate aggregation
  node if there exists aggregation and then generate orderby if there exists
  orderby. 

  5. Finally, it returns a new Project objected constructed with
  outFields, outTypes and node
